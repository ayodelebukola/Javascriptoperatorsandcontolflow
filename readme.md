QUESTION 2
- Arithmetic Operators 

let x = 100;
let y = 10;
let z = 5;

For addition (+) 
    console.log(x + y);
    // Answer is 110.

    console.log(y + z);
    // Answer is 15.    

For subtraction (-)
    console.log(x - y);
    // Answer is 90.

    console.log(y - z);
    // Answer is 5.

For multiplication (*)
    console.log(x * y);
    // Answer is 1000.

    console.log(y * z);
    // Answer is 50.

For division (/)
    console.log(x / y);
    // Answer is 10.

    console.log(y / z);
    // Answer is 2.

For modulo (%)
    console.log(x % y);
    // Answer is 0.

    console.log(y % z);
    // Answer is 0.

For exponential (**)
    console.log(x ** y);
    // Answer is 100000000000000000000.

    console.log(y ** z);
    // Answer is 100000.

For increment (++)
    console.log( ++x);
    // Answer is 101.

    console.log( x++);
    // Answer is 100.

For decrement (--)
    console.log(--x);
    // Answer is 99.

    console.log( x--);
    // Answer is 100.


- Assignment Operators

let x = 10

Symbol is (=)
Addition assignment operators(+=)
    console.log(x += 5) 
    //Answer is 15.

    console.log(x += 15) 
    //Answer is 25.

Subtraction assignment operators(-=)
    console.log(x -= 5) 
    //Answer is 15.

    console.log(x -= 15) 
    //Answer is -5.

Multiplication assignment operators(*=)
    console.log(x *= 5) 
    //Answer is 50.

    console.log(x *= 15) 
    //Answer is 750.

- Comparison Operators
let a = 100
let b = 200
let c = 100

For equal (==)
    console.log(a == b)
    //Answer is false

    console.log(a == c)
    //Answer is true

For not equal (!=)
    console.log(5!=5) 
    //Answer is false.

    console.log(9!=9)
    //Answer is false.

For strict equal  (===)
let a = 100
let b = 200
let c = 100
let d = '200'

   console.log(a === c)
    //Answer is true 

    console.log(b == d)
    //Answer is false

For not strict equal (!==)
    console.log(5!=='5') 
    //Answer is true.

    console.log(9!=='9') 
    //Answer is true.

For greater than (>)
let a = 100
let b = 200
let c = 100

    console.log(a > b)
    //Answer is false.

    console.log(b < a)
    //Answer is true.

For greater than or equal to (>=)
    console.log(a >= b)
    //Answer is false.

For less than (<)
    console.log(b < a)
    //Answer is false.

    console.log(a < b)
    //Answer is true.

For less than or equal to (<=)
    console.log(b <= a)
    //Answer is false

    console.log (a <= b>)
    //Answer is true.

- Logical Operators
For logical AND (&&)
For logical OR (||)
For logical NOT (!)

let i < 20;
console.log(i);
//Answer is true.

let i+= 7;
console.log(i);
//Answer is 8.
